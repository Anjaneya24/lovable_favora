### **Use Case: Location-Based Offer Discovery Platform (JSON-Driven)**

#### **Objective**
Build a web application that delivers personalized offers and recommendations based on the user's current location or searched address. Offers may include:
- Mall promotions  
- Salon and spa discounts  
- Gym memberships or trial offers  
- Favorite food deals  
- Must-visit local attractions  

#### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React.js  
  - Responsive UI for browsing offers  
  - Search box for entering location or address manually  
  - Map integration to visualize nearby deals  

- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
  - Handles API requests and business logic  
  - Processes location data and user preferences  
  - Reads and writes offer data from **JSON files** instead of a database  

- **LLM Integration**:  
  - Understands user queries in natural language (e.g., “Show me food deals near Banjara Hills”)  
  - Generates personalized suggestions and summaries  
  - Handles ambiguous or conversational inputs  

#### **Data Storage**
- **Offers JSON File**: Stores all available offers with fields like:
  ```json
  {
    "offers": [
      {
        "id": "001",
        "title": "50% off at XYZ Mall",
        "category": "mall",
        "location": "Banjara Hills",
        "coordinates": [17.4123, 78.4485],
        "valid_until": "2025-08-10"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Agents JSON File**: Stores agent addresses or locations:
  ```json
  {
    "agents": [
      {
        "id": "A001",
        "name": "Mall Agent",
        "location": "Gachibowli",
        "coordinates": [17.4445, 78.3772]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

#### **Key Features**
1. **Location Detection**
   - Auto-detect user location via GPS  
   - Manual location/address input via search box  

2. **Offer Aggregation**
   - Load offers from JSON file  
   - Filter based on proximity and user preferences  

3. **Personalization via LLM**
   - Interpret user intent from natural language  
   - Recommend offers based on past behavior or stated interests  
   - Summarize offers in a conversational tone  

4. **User Interaction**
   - Save favorite offers  
   - Share deals with others  
   - View offer details and redemption instructions  

5. **Admin Panel (Optional)**
   - Upload and manage offers via JSON editor or form  
   - Monitor user engagement and feedback  

#### **Benefits**
- **Convenience**: Users get relevant offers without searching multiple platforms  
- **Personalization**: LLM tailors suggestions to individual preferences  
- **Efficiency**: JSON-based storage simplifies setup and reduces overhead  
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supports expansion to new cities or categories
